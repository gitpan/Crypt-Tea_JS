This module implements TEA, the Tiny Encryption Algorithm, and some
Modes of Use based on CBC, compatibly in both Perl and JavaScript.
This enables CGI scripts to communicate with browsers, as well as working
as a normal private-key strong-encryption engine.

Subroutines offer encryption, decryption & digest, and all cyphertext
is ascii-encoded to prevent munging. Another routine returns JavaScript
code with identical functions, and this can be used by CGIs to feed to
a browser. A wrapper executable 'tea' is included for command-line use.

Crypt::Tea_JS is the continuation of Crypt::Tea under another name.
(Microsoft systems confused the old name with a different module
Crypt::TEA and were unable to install both).  The calling interface
is identical.  I've taken advantage of the change of name to offer
 * the New Improved version of the Tea algorithm, which provides even
   stronger encryption. Backward-compatibility with files encrypted by
   Crypt::Tea is, however, lost :-(
 * implementation in C of some of the core routines, for improved
   performance (at the server end, if you're using it in a CGI context)

To install just:
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
